00:00.410 --> 00:01.246
So because the

00:01.268 --> 00:01.854
Kansas City

00:01.892 --> 00:02.446
Chiefs are

00:02.468 --> 00:02.974
playing. My

00:03.012 --> 00:03.742
daughter is

00:03.796 --> 00:05.450
watching NFL

00:05.530 --> 00:06.286
football with

00:06.308 --> 00:06.846
me for the

00:06.868 --> 00:07.566
first time in

00:07.588 --> 00:08.078
her entire

00:08.164 --> 00:08.958
life. And I

00:08.964 --> 00:09.454
want to be very

00:09.492 --> 00:09.978
clear. I'm

00:09.994 --> 00:10.446
grateful to

00:10.468 --> 00:11.114
Taylor Swift

00:11.162 --> 00:11.454
for this

00:11.492 --> 00:11.934
experience,

00:12.052 --> 00:12.766
because we all

00:12.788 --> 00:13.086
know it

00:13.108 --> 00:13.534
wouldn't be

00:13.572 --> 00:13.822
happening

00:13.876 --> 00:14.782
without her.

00:14.916 --> 00:17.294
But I do wonder

00:17.492 --> 00:18.238
if there's sort

00:18.244 --> 00:19.066
of an alternate

00:19.098 --> 00:19.806
universe where

00:19.828 --> 00:20.394
Taylor Swift

00:20.442 --> 00:20.814
might have,

00:20.852 --> 00:21.630
like, started

00:21.700 --> 00:22.906
dating an AFC

00:22.938 --> 00:23.386
Wimbledon

00:23.418 --> 00:23.886
player, like

00:23.908 --> 00:24.286
somebody who

00:24.308 --> 00:24.718
plays in the

00:24.724 --> 00:25.366
fourth tier of

00:25.388 --> 00:26.034
English soccer.

00:26.082 --> 00:27.446
Because then I

00:27.468 --> 00:28.374
could truly be

00:28.412 --> 00:28.886
living the
